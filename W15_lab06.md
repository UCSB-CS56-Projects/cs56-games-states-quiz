Overall the project seems to be very well-made.  Everything runs correctly as described in the original README. Any
work I do on this legacy code project will probably center around either restructuring the class hierarchy present
in the codebase or implementing new features to work together with the existing codebase.

Possible improvements:
* Adjust design of the class hierarchy such that static members are minimized, resulting in cleaner dependencies
between different objects.
* Add test cases to verify the functionality of the text parsing for the states as well as in many other portions of
the code.
* Add new features to the project.  For example, different kinds of quizzes, or maybe even quizzes for different
countries.
